        <p>
            Unlocks automatically at level 10 if you own ANY expansion. <span class="raptor">Raptor</span> Masteries are trained in Path of Fire.
        </p>
        <p>
            As your first mount, the <span class="raptor">Raptor</span> is a good A to B mount, having an average run speed, and a jump that lets you move any smaller gaps.
            Once you train the masteries, it'll jump further and pull enemies together with Tail Spin.
            At max mastery, it increases the damage of all the other mounts engage skills.

        <h3 class="springer"><a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Springer">Springer</a></h3>
        <p>
            Own PoF, EoD, or JW to unlock. <span class="springer">Springer</span> Masteries are trained in Path of Fire.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <span class="springer">Springer</span> can be unlocked 3 ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Path of Fire</h4>
                <p>
                    Completing the heart at Highjump Ranch[&BCMKAAA=] and purchasing it for 50 Trade Contracts and 1 Gold.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>End of Dragons</h4>
                <p>
                    Talking to the heart npc Lieutenant Zhao in Grub Lane, east of Lutgardis Plaza Waypoint[&BCANAAA=]. You do not need to complete the heart.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Janthir Wilds</h4>
                <p>
                    Starting the Janthir Wilds story. Clearly this is the easiest way.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The <span class="springer">Springer</span> is the second mount you can get in PoF, after <span class="raptor">Raptor</span>. 
            It can jump high and has a high CC dismount skill.
            Training the masteries will let the <span class="springer">Springer</span> jump higher, have more CC on Cannonball, and reduces it's fall damage.
            At max mastery, all mounts gain the reduced fall damage.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sadly, the <span class="springer">Springer</span> gets outclassed in both how high it can jump, and how much CC it can do. 
            The <span class="skyscale">Skyscale</span> can scale significantly higher cliffs,
            and the <span class="warclaw">Warclaw</span> can do significantly more breakbar damage.
        </p>

        <h3 class="skimmer"><a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Skimmer">Skimmer</a></h3>
        <p>
            Own PoF to unlock and train the <span class="skimmer">Skimmer</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            To unlock the <span class="skimmer">Skimmer</span>, you must complete the heart at Skimmer Ranch [&BGcKAAA=] and then purchase it for 50 Trade Contracts and 4 Gold.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <span class="skimmer">Skimmer</span> is THE water mount in Guild Wars 2. 
            It's able to cruise above or submarine below and get around quickly. 
            The <span class="skimmer">Skimmer</span> can also float over land but is slower than most other mounts outside of the water.
        </p>
        <p>
            Upgrading the masteries will let it hover higher, heal allies with Barrel Roll, and swim underwater.
            Nimble Recovery will give you Protection and Swiftness whenever you're knocked off of your <span class="skimmer">Skimmer</span>.
            Nimble Benevolence will allow all your mounts to take on the same effect.
            The final mastery, Skimming the Depths, allows your <span class="skimmer">Skimmer</span> to swim underwater.
        </p>
        <p>
            The SotO convergences have some water that will dismount you if you run into the deep end. The <span class="skimmer">Skimmer</span> can get you out faster than just swimming.

            Own PoF to unlock and train the <span class="jackal">Jackal</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            To unlock the <span class="jackal">Jackal</span>, you must complete the heart at the Djinn Enclave [&BOYKAAA=] and then purchase it for 200 Trade Contracts and 20 Gold.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <span class="jackal">Jackal</span> can move by blinking, dissappearing and reappearing a short distance away. <span class="jackal">Jackals</span> can also use sand portals to teleport larger distances.
        </p>
        <p>
            Training the <span class="jackal">Jackal</span> masteries will allow it to use the sand portals, and grant a sand barrier to allies when it pounces.
            The last mastery, Adroit Evasion, lets all mounts evade attacks when using a movement ability.
        </p>
        <p>
            While the <span class="jackal">Jackal</span> is not all that useful outside of PoF, granting evasion on movement abilities for all mounts makes it worth spending the points on the <span class="jackal">Jackal</span>.

        <h3 class="beetle"><a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Roller_Beetle">Roller Beetle</a></h3>
        <p>
            Own PoF and LWS4 to unlock and train the <span style="color:rgb(221,144,73);">Roller Beetle</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlocking the <span class="beetle">Roller Beetle</span> requires completing the second chapter, Forearmed is Forewarned, from the Living World Season 4 Episode 3: Long Live the Lich.
            Talk to Spearmarshal Zaeim during the third chapter, Tactical Triage. He is in a building on the southern side of the Allied Encampment [&BFcLAAA=].
            Then talk to Gorrik on the northern side of the camp and complete the collections he asks you to do.
        </p>
        <p>
            The roller beetle is a great mount if you have a long distance to cover and relatively flat land to traverse, having the ability to go just as fast as the griffon.
            The <span class="beetle">Roller Beetle's</span> biggest weakness is running into objects and losing all of its momentum. 
            If you don't have any energy to get back up to speed, the <span class="beetle">Roller Beetle</span> is slower than even the turtle.
            Don't hesitate to use Bond of Vigor to regain your endurance quickly.

            The warclaw is a great mount for rough terrain, as it can just bounce over anything that's not flat.
            It also has great CC skills, having the ability to put out over 1k breakbar damage in under 10 seconds.
