    <h3>Dreadwing</h3>
    Dreadwing is a fire breathing wyvern based kryptis.<br>
    <br>
    <h4>Strategy</h4>
    Dreadwing has several fire based attacks and physical attacks with their body.<br>
    You can avoid most of their attacks by just sticking behind and to the left of them.<br>
    When DW starts flapping their wings, CC quickly to break the breakbar and get some exposed DPS time.<br>
