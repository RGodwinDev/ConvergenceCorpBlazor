    <h3>Demon Knight</h3>
    <!-- description here -->
    <br>
    <h4>Strategy</h4>
    Demon Knight is pretty simple. If you get a meteor on you, take it far away from the group.<br>
    If you get hit by a <span style="color:rgb(34,177,76)">Tyrant's Contempt</span> orb and pulled, quickly mount your warclaw to escape being blasted by <span style="color:rgb(255,0,0)">Callous Retribution</span>.<br>
    When Demon Knights breakbar is up, break it ASAP. The longer it's up, the more damaging <span style="color:rgb(0,255,255)">Wrathful Aura</span> becomes.<br>
    This mostly affects the people that have <span style="color:rgb(255,127,39)">Wrath of Firmament</span> the hardest, as they have to leave the safety of the groups healers.<br>
    <br>
    <h4>Demon Knight's Skills</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h5 style="color:rgb(0, 225, 255)">Wrathful Aura(Passive)</h5>
            Demon Knight has an aura that hurts players nearby.<br>
            When the breakbar is up, this aura hurts significantly more and has greater range.<br>
            Break the breakbar ASAP whenever it comes up to prevent <span style="color:rgb(0,255,255)">Wrathful Aura</span> from becoming an issue.<br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5 style="color:rgb(255,127,39)">Wrath of Firmament(Meteors)</h5>
            Death Knight fires a beam into the air, summoning meteors that target players.<br>
            The later in the fight, the more meteors that get summoned.<br>

            <br>
            The targeted players get giant multilayered circular AoEs and orange firey borders indicating that they have the meteor.<br>
            The targeted players should run far away from the main group, so the meteors don't fall on them.<br>

        </li>
        <li>
            <h5 style="color:rgb(255, 113, 78)">Shards of Wrath(Meteor Secondary)</h5> <!-- should be another orange -->
            Additional meteors follow the initial <span style="color:rgb(255,127,39)">Wrath of Firmament</span> meteor.<br>
            They bombard the area around the initial impact in two rings.<br>

        </li>

            <h5 style="color:rgb(34,177,76)">Tyrant's Contempt(Orbs)</h5>
            Death Knight fires 6 orbs that create an aoe, then each <span style="color:rgb(181,230,29)">explode into 6 more orbs</span>.<br>
            Each of the 6 orbs move outward, and then converge back to where they started.<br>
            If you're hit by an orb, they will pull you to where they are converging.<br>
            Demon Knight then combos <span style="color:rgb(255,0,0)">CR</span> on the orbs that got the most players.<br>

            <h5 style="color:rgb(0,162,232)">Tyrant's Teeth</h5>
            Demon Knight shoots out multiple lines across the ground, damaging once initially, then pulsing a few seconds later for even more damage.<br>
            The later in the fight, the more lines Demon Knight shoots out.<br>

        </li>

            <h5>Sweeping Judgment</h5>
            Still trying to figure this out, it's after TT/CR and before TW.
