    <h3>Shared Boss Mechanics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4 style="color:rgb(255, 128, 0);">Zojja</h4>
            During the boss phase, <span style="color:rgb(255,128,0);">Zojja</span> is using her power to make the boss vulnerable.<br>
            If her health falls to 0, she will pull everyone back to the Wizard's Tower.<br>
            Feed her the essence dropped by the boss to keep her healthy.<br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Essence</h4>
            The bosses drop essence every 10% of their health and at the end of each phase.<br>
            DPS players should hold onto it as long as they can for a significant power boost.<br>
            Healers and boondps players should be feeding theirs to <span style="color:rgb(255,128,0)"> Zojja</span> to keep her healthy.<br>
            Don't overfeed her when her HP is full, as the essence just gets wasted.<br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Phasing</h4>
            Every 25%, the boss will move to a new island.<br>
            Which island they go to is random, and they won't revisit an island they've already been to.<br>
            The last phase will always go to the middle island.<br>
        </li>
    </ul>
