<h1>Movement!</h1>
In convergences, being able to move well matters.
<h3>Masteries</h3>
There are several masteries that deal with improved movement. While they're not all required for convergences, most are used at least once during each run.

                Gliding - 31 points
                <ul>
                    <li>

                    <li>
                        Lean Techniques - Move forward and back to speedup and slowdown while gliding. Drains endurance.
                    </li>

                        Stealth Gliding - Stealth while gliding by dodging.

                    <li>
                        Advanced Gliding - Gliding doesn't drain endurance. Lean Techniques still do.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ley Line Gliding - Ley lines can be rode while gliding.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <li>
                Itzel Lore - 1 point
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Bouncing Mushrooms - You can bounce off bouncing mushrooms.

            <li>
                Ancient Magics - 10 points
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Spectral Aid - While not a movement skill, it's a great skill to use if you get downed, dealing a large chunk of damage over a large area and hopefully killing a random mob to get up.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h4>Path of Fire</h4> 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Raptor Mount - 10 points
                <ul>
                    <li>Round up - Raptor engage skill now pulls nearby enemys together.</li>
                    <li>Canyon Jumping - Raptor can leap further.</li>
                    <li>Ravenous Discipline - All mounts get increased damage on their engage skill.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The raptor is a good A to B mount, having an average run speed, but a jump that lets you move smaller distances very fast. If it could be used from combat, it would be more useful than warclaw in get away from x situations.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Springer Mount - 14 points
                <ul>
                    <li>Masterful Descent - All mounts gain greater fall damage tolerance (not immune, just reduced damage).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The springer gets outclassed in all ways by the skyscale and warclaw. The only reason to put points into it is for the fall damage reduction.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Skimmer Mount - 14 points
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Nimble Benevolence - All mounts get Nimble Recovery. If you get knocked off or engage with a mount, you'll gain swiftness and protection.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The SotO convergences have some water, making the skimmer good for getting out of the water if you fall in. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Jackal Mount - 14 points
                <ul>
                    <li>Adroit Evasion - All mounts gain evasion on movement abilities.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>While not all that useful outside of PoF, granting evasion on movement abilities for all mounts makes it worth spending the points on the jackal.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Roller Beetle Mount - 12 points - Requires LW4
                <ul> 
                    <li>
                        Big Air - perform tricks in the air and regain endurance. penalized if you land badly.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The roller beetle is a great mount if you have a long distance to cover and relatively flat land to traverse, having the ability to go just as fast as the griffon. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>

                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Skyscale Mount - 12 points - Requires LW4
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Air Rescue - You can mount and dismount your skyscale midair.
                    </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Bond of Life - You share YOUR hp with your mount. While this makes you tankier while mounted, if you lose your hp while mounted, you go down instead of just dismounting.</li>
                    <li>Bond of Vigor - Increases the endurance regen rate significantly for a short time. I use this often to gain more height or speed.</li>
                    <li>Bond of Faith - Lets you launch from your mount a good distance very quickly. It's weakness is you can't really control it while in use.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

                    </li>
                </ul>
                While not particularly useful in convergences, the turtle can be used to attempt to get people stuck in the walls out.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

                    <li>Feral Fury - Skill 4 and 1 now do increased CC.</li>
