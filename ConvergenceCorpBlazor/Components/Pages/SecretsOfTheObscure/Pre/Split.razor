            The split phase starts once all three <span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);">champions</span> in <span style="color:rgb(255,255,0);">mid</span> have been killed.
            Each corner (<span style="color:rgb(0,255,255)">NW</span> <span style="color:rgb(255,105,180);">NE</span> <span style="color:rgb(154,205,50);">SW</span> <span style="color:rgb(0,128,0);">SE</span>), becomes active and spawns 5 lieutenants each.
            Kill all 5 lieutenants in a corner and that corners general will spawn. Kill the general and the corner will be finished.
            When all four corners are finished, the split phase ends and the boss phase begins.

            2 subgroups should go to each corner.
            2 subgroups should stay <span style="color:rgb(255,255,0)">mid</span> to defend <span style="color:rgb(255,128,0);">Zojja</span>

            When a corner is finished, the 2 subgroups should return <span style="color:rgb(255,255,0)">mid</span> and help with <span style="color:rgb(255,128,0);">Zojja</span> and the <span style="color:rgb(255,0,0)">spites</span>.

        <p>
            During the split phase, the <span style="color:rgb(0, 140, 255);">trebuchets</span> should be mostly ignored.
            A player with projectile blocking skills can stop the treb shots from hitting <span style="color:rgb(255,128,0);">Zojja</span>, but this isn't required.
            Each <span style="color:rgb(0, 140, 255);">trebuchet</span> will perish when the general in their corner is killed.

    <div>
        <h3 id="NW" style="color:rgb(0,255,255);">Northwest - The Spire</h3>
        <p>
            The northwest corner is a complicated corner.
            Start at 1 in the bottom left.
            1 to 2, use your warclaw to bounce over the rocky terrain.
            2 to 3, combat mount your skyscale and dash to 3. Alternatively, use the skyscale launcher at L or just scale the rocks up to 3.
            3 to 4 can be glided or warclawd over.
            4 to 5, use the mushroom at M.
            If someone has a <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/White_Mantle_Portal_Device">White Mantle Portal Device</a>, they can portal the group from 4 to 5.
            If you're the person using the device, make sure to declare to the group that you are doing so to avoid confusion.
            They have a 30 minute CD and so can only be used once every other run.
            Setup the portal while the group fights lieutenant 4.
            After killing the 5th lieutenant, jump off immediately and griffon to the general.

        <h3 id="NE" style="color:rgb(255,105,180);">Northeast - Watcher of the Woods</h3>
        <p>
            The northeast corner is an easier corner, start at 1 and follow the path!
            When dropping down from 1, make sure to use a mount or glide. You'll die from fall damage.
        </p>

    <div>
        <h3 id="SW" style="color:rgb(154,205,50);">Southwest - Twisted Cathedral</h3>
        <p>
            The southwest corner is more complicated than the others, having multiple levels and a bit of an unintuitive path.
            From mid, head to the bottom at lhotpinkieutenant 1.
            Warclaw/Raptor to 2.
            From 2 to 3, you can use your skyscale and either scale up the side of the pillar directly, or use the smaller pillar directly southeast as a step stool.
            Someone can also bring along a <a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/White_Mantle_Portal_Device">White Mantle Portal Device</a> to portal the group from 2 to 3.
            If you're the person using the device, make sure to declare to the group that you are doing so to avoid confusion.
            They have a 30 minute CD and so can only be used once every other run.
            Setup the portal while the group fights lieutenant 2.
            The gap from 3 to 4 can be skyscaled, warclawed, or glided over if you have the gliding skill Ride the Ley Line.
            After getting on the upper level, it's pretty easy from there.

        <h3 id="SE" style="color:rgb(0,128,0);">Southeast - The Killing Fields</h3>
        <p>
            The southeast corner is pretty simple.
            From <span style="color:rgb(255,255,0);">mid</span>, theres a skyscale launcher near the waters edge on the way to <span style="color:rgb(0,128,0);">southeast</span>.
            Take it to get up to 1 easier.
            The fall from 1 to 2 is high enough to kill you, so mount up or glide down to prevent dying to fall damage.

        <p>
            After your corners general dies, head <span style="color:rgb(255,255,0)">mid</span> to help defend <span style="color:rgb(255,128,0)">Zojja</span>.
            Only help another corner if they are SIGNIFICANTLY behind (on lieutenant 4 or before).
            Heading to another corner will only scale up their lieutenants and general.
            When all four generals have been defeated, one of the five final bosses will start.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before the boss spawns, <span style="color:rgb(255,128,0)">Zojja</span> can still take healing from sources other than <span style="color:rgb()">Kryptis Essence</span>. 
            The skimmer's Water Jets skill from Visions of Eternity can be used to heal Zojja.
            The goal is to get <span style="color:rgb(255,128,0)">Zojja</span> over 80%, as she will gain 20% back by herself when the boss spawns.
