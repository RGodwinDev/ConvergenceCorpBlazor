    <image src="images/JW/Lowland_Expertise.png" alt="lowland expertise icon" style="width:40px;"/>
    <p>
        Lowland Expertise is a buff you can purchase from each of the <image src="https://render.guildwars2.com/file/B3DEEC72BBEF0C6FC6FEF835A0E275FCB1151BB7/102439.png" alt="heart" style="width:20px;"/>hearts in Janthir Wilds.
        This buff is per character, so you'll need to do this for each character you plan to Converge with.
        Each stack of Lowland Expertise gives a different buff:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>+10% Experience</li>
        <li>+10% Karma</li>
        <li>+10% Gold</li>
        <li>Additional map material from kodan caches</li>
        <li>Gain <image src="https://render.guildwars2.com/file/96D90DF84CAFE008233DD1C2606A12C1A0E68048/102842.png" alt="fury icon" style="width:20px;"/>fury when striking an enemy with the warclaw's dismount attack</li>
        <li>Gain additional Unusual Coins from kodan caches</li>
        <li>+5% Damage vs. titanspawn</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        As far as Convergences go, we care only about the 5th and 7th stacks.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can farm all 7 stacks in a single day. Each of the <image src="https://render.guildwars2.com/file/B3DEEC72BBEF0C6FC6FEF835A0E275FCB1151BB7/102439.png" alt="heart" style="width:20px;"/>hearts in Janthir Wilds sells it after completing that heart.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each time you buy Lowland Expertise, it adds a stack. Additional purchases won't increase it past 7 stacks, but will increase the timer before it expires by 4 hours. This timer also caps at 24 hours.
        You should only need to do some <image src="https://render.guildwars2.com/file/B3DEEC72BBEF0C6FC6FEF835A0E275FCB1151BB7/102439.png" alt="heart" style="width:20px;"/>hearts every couple days to keep the buff up, as it doesn't count down unless you're logged in on that character. 
    </p>
    <p>If you let it expire, you will need to redo all 7 stacks.</p>
