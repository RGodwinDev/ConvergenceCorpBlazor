    <br>
    The initial phase of a Mt. Balrior Convergence is to escort the teams pack dolyak up to the Base Camp.<br>
    On the way you'll be met with waves of Titanspawn Bombers.<br>
    The bombers are susceptible to CC and will die quickly when their breakbar is broken.<br>
    While the dolyak is traveling, it can be given swiftness or superspeed to help speed things along.<br>
