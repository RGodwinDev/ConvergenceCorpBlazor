<h3>Greer, the Blightbringer</h3>
Poison | Area Control | Boon Corruption
<br>

<h4>Strategy</h4>
<br>

<h5>Gree and Reeg</h5>
Gree, the Bringer and Reeg, the Blighter are at the start of each phase.<br>
They are positioned on opposite sides of Greer from each other.<br>
Fight them before moving on to Greer.<br>
They go away after losing 25% of their hp each phase.<br>
<br>

<h5>Breakbar</h5>
Each phase has a breakbar to break when Greer gets to a health threshhold.<br>
These threshholds are 80%, 60%, 30%, 10%.<br>
The Warclaw 3 and 4 skills put out significant amounts of CC, mount up and use them until the bar is gone.<br>
Greer bombards the area while the breakbar is up (similar to leyline anom/vale guardian from w1)<br>
<br>

<h4>Greer's skills</h4>
Each skill continues on in the later phases, usually increasing in the amount of circles or projectiles per skill use.

                <h5 style="color:lightgreen;">Eruption of Rot(Greens)</h5>
                People at random get green circles on them.<br>
                An icon above them indicates how many people need to be inside the green circle to satisfy it.<br>
                If the green is not satisfied, a large purple aoe is spawned directly on the person.<br>

                <h5>Blob of Blight(Orbs)</h5>
                Greer spawns several purple/gold orbs that chase the furthest people from him.<br>
